* VTK does not build correctly when VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 is ON and HDF5 was built
  with HL enabled (which is needed for NetCDF). To solution currently  is to
  manually edit the CMake variable HDF5_C_LIBRARY to be
  <INSTALL_DIR>/lib/libhdf5.so;<INSTALL_DIR>/lib/libhdf5_hl.so
  It cannot be set in paraview.cmake file, unfortunately.
* MPICH2 does not build correctly when make -j<N> is used. Simply run a
  non-parallel make.
* Need libXrender to ensure that Icons and fonts render smoothly.
* If Manta fails to build with SSE, set USE_SSE flag to OFF.
